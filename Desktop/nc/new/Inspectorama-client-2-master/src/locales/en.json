Inspectorama's address for such notices is:&nbsp;<ahref='mailto:legal@inspectorama.com'>legal@inspectorama.com</a> and/or by mail to Zigma Inspection Services AS, Klems gate 34, Kongsberg, 3613, Norway.</p><p>b.<u>Arbitration.</u> If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations, you and Inspectorama agree to resolve any and all Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) through final and binding arbitration (<strong>'Arbitration Agreement'</strong>). This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the<strong>'AAA Rules'</strong>) of the American Arbitration Association (<strong>'AAA'</strong>) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (<strong>'AAA Consumer Rules'</strong>), both of which are available at the AAA website (www.adr.org).

If you are unable to pay such costs, Inspectorama will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. Each party will pay the fees for his/her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing. Additionally, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the 'Class Action Waiver' described in Section d below.</p><p>c.<u>Excluded Disputes.</u> You and Inspectorama agree that the following Disputes are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (1) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or our intellectual property rights; (2) individual claims in small claims court; (3) any claim that an applicable federal statute expressly states cannot be arbitrated; and (4) any claim for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief on the ground that without such relief the arbitration provided in this Arbitration Agreement may be rendered ineffectual.</p><p>d.<u>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION.</u></p><p>You and Inspectorama agree to bring any Dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action. There will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action (<strong>'Class Action Waiver'</strong>). Regardless of anything else in this Arbitration Agreement and/or the applicable AAA Rules or AAA Consumer Rules, the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Class Action Waiver may only be determined by a court and not an arbitrator.</p><p>e.<u>Rules/Standards Governing Arbitration Proceeding.</u> A party who wishes to arbitrate a Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement must initiate an arbitration proceeding no later than the expiration of the statute of limitations that applicable law prescribes for the claim asserted. The arbitrator shall apply the statute of limitations that would have applied if the Dispute had been brought in court. The arbitrator may award any remedy to which a party is entitled under applicable law, but remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in their individual capacity, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual under applicable law will be forfeited. The arbitrator is without authority to apply any different substantive law. The parties have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any dispute in this regard shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall take place in the city or county where you reside, unless each party agrees otherwise. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator's decision/award.</p><p>f.<u>Severability.</u> You and Inspectorama agree that if any portion of this section entitled 'Mutual Arbitration Agreement' is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of this section 19 will be given full force and effect.</p>",

Inspectorama is not a party to any contracts for Professional Services. The Inspectorama Platform facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium through which Requesters can connect with Professionals, schedule certain Professional Services, and make payments for certain Professional Services (<strong>'Payments'</strong>). Requesters are obligated to pay in advance for those Professional Services they order through the Inspectorama Platform. Prior to the scheduled Professional Service, we will charge the Requester's credit card according to the amount the Requester has agreed to on the Inspectorama Platform with respect to those Professional Services, the Requester has ordered, and for all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees, expenses or applicable taxes associated with a Professional Service as well as the Trust and Support Fee (as defined in 3(f) below), and the Requester hereby authorizes us to charge the credit card on file in the Requester's Inspectorama Platform account for such amounts. We will use third party services to process credit card information. By accepting this Agreement, you are giving Inspectorama (or a third-party payment processor on Inspectorama’s behalf) permission to charge your on-file credit card, debit card, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you owe Inspectorama. Depending on the transaction you selected or services requested, Inspectorama may charge you on a one-time or recurring basis. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Professional Services must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with Inspectorama at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to place a hold on the Requester's credit card for an ordered or completed Professional Service transaction. Seventy-two (72) hours after a Professional Service is completed, if there is no complaint by the Requester, we will mark the Professional Service as closed. If the Requester has agreed with the Professional change, cancel or to reschedule a requested Professional Service, the Requester bears the responsibility for notifying Inspectorama. Requesters must notify Inspectorama either by changing the date or time of the requested Professional Service through the Inspectorama Platform or by visiting the Inspectorama Help Center at&nbsp;<a href='http://www.inspectorama.com/help'>www.inspectorama.com/help</a>. All Payments by Requesters must be made through the Inspectorama Platform. Any Professional Services, any Payments paid, or any Professional Services scheduled or obtained outside of the Inspectorama Platform are not subject to our terms and conditions. Except for the Refund Policy in Section 3(e), no refunds or credits will be provided once the Requester's credit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific promotions, or to correct any errors we have made. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. Requesters will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Professional Service(s) provided (other than taxes based on Inspectorama's income). If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Inspectorama or third parties, then Inspectorama may withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to Inspectorama or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (i) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (ii) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (iii) reverse any credits to your bank account; or (iv) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or to repeatedly violate this Agreement, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you.</p><p>b.<u>Job Rate.</u> The rate per hour for a Professional Service (<strong>'Job Rate'</strong>) depends on factors, such as location and how frequently a Recurrent Service is ordered, and payment terms may increase. Therefore, the same Professional Service may cost more in a different location or if the Professional Service is ordered less frequently. However, you will be notified prior to any such payment increase with sufficient notice to enable you to cancel the Recurrent Service as set forth herein.</p><p>c.<u>Recurrent Service with Automatic Renewal and Recurring Charges.</u></p><p>(i) Recurring Service: When requesting certain Professional Services, Requesters may have the option of choosing that the Professional Service be repeated on a regular basis (<strong>'Recurrent Service'</strong>).</p><p>(ii) BILLING, RECURRING CHARGES AND AUTOMATIC RENEWAL: When a Requester signs up for a Recurring Service, Requester will be charged immediately for the initial booking. THEREAFTER, REQUESTER'S AGREEMENT TO PAY FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND REQUESTER'S CREDIT CARD WILL BE CHARGED THE SAME NON-PROMOTIONAL AMOUNT, AS ORIGINALLY DISCLOSED TO REQUESTER AT THE TIME OF SIGNING UP FOR THE RECURRING SERVICE, IN ADVANCE OF EACH AUTOMATICALLY SCHEDULED PROFESSIONAL SERVICE APPOINTMENT, AS WELL AS FOR ANY APPLICABLE CANCELLATION FEES AND TAXES.</p><p>(iii) CANCELLATION OF AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING RECURRING SERVICE: Requesters may cancel the automatically renewing Recurrent Service AT ANY TIME by visiting the Inspectorama Help Center at<a href='http://www.inspectorama.com/help'>www.inspectorama.com/help</a> or by mailing a notice of cancellation to Zigma Inspection Services AS, Klems gate 34, Kongsberg, 3613, Norway.
